VectorGuardProxy is a lightweight, auditable “message notarization” service. The /proxy command turns any business message (instructions, approvals, notices, alerts) into a tamper-evident record with verifiable provenance.

How it works (business view)
	•	Provenance capture: When a user issues /proxy …, the system binds the message to the Client ID and Agent ID, adds a transport ID (the request), a precise timestamp, and a standardized envelope.
	•	Integrity sealing: The full record is hashed (MD5, SHA-256, SHA-512). Any change to content or identifiers breaks the hash and is detectable.
	•	Canonical output: The result is returned as human-readable text (for emails, chats, tickets) and structured data (for systems). Both carry identical IDs and hashes for reconciliation.
	•	Observability: Every step is labeled (zone → feature → context → action → state) so operations can trace who did what, where, and when—without exposing sensitive device details in the visible record.

Why it matters
	•	Regulatory readiness: Provides chain-of-custody style evidence for audits, subpoenas, SOX/GxP/ISO and internal controls—without a heavy compliance suite.
	•	Dispute defense: Clear, time-stamped proof of approvals/notifications reduces losses from repudiation and “he-said/she-said” conflicts.
	•	Vendor simplification: One core workflow replaces many bespoke “acknowledge/approve” plugins, cutting integration and license sprawl.
	•	Security posture: Cryptographic sealing plus identity binding significantly raises the cost of spoofing, insider tampering, or log redaction.

Primary use cases
	1.	Executive approvals: Capital expenditures, pricing exceptions, vendor onboarding.
	2.	Operations handoffs: Shift changes, maintenance completions, incident bridges.
	3.	Customer communications: Critical notices (outages, recalls, compliance updates).
	4.	Procurement & finance: PO confirmations, rate locks, fund release instructions.
	5.	HR & legal: Policy acknowledgements, investigation notes, litigation holds.

Deployment options
	•	Side-car service: Drop-in API in front of chat, ticketing, and email systems.
	•	Gateway pattern: Enforce that specific workflows must pass through /proxy.
	•	Embedded bot: Command available in collaboration tools (Slack/Teams/Matrix).

Data model (simplified)
	•	Visible fields: transport ID, timestamp (epoch + human), client ID, agent ID, hashes.
	•	Hidden in hash: device/profile constants retained for forensics but not displayed.
	•	Outputs: text, html, and data (JSON) for downstream systems/archives.

Governance & controls
	•	Policy binding: Only approved subcommands/“options” execute; everything else fails closed.
	•	RBAC & rate limits: Enforced per client/agent; actions are enumerated and audited.
	•	Retention: Configurable WORM storage integration for records that require immutability.
	•	Privacy: No personal device details in the visible envelope; redaction rules configurable.

Integration & effort
	•	API-first: Single endpoint; message + optional options array.
	•	Low-code adapters: Webhooks for common systems (ServiceNow, Jira, Zendesk, O365/GSuite).
	•	Backfill: Existing messages can be proxied in batch to bootstrap audit trails.

KPIs to track
	•	% of critical workflows routed via /proxy
	•	Median time from event → notarized record
	•	Verification success rate (replay hash match)
	•	Dispute rate reduction & avoided losses
	•	Audit finding severity/volume trend

Risk & mitigation
	•	Operational risk: Misuse or bypass → enforce gateway rules and alert on non-proxied events.
	•	Key management: Hash trust requires secure key/material handling → use HSM/KMS and rotate.
	•	Human error: Clear UX prompts and templated commands reduce malformed entries.

ROI snapshot
	•	Cost avoidance: Fewer audit exceptions, reduced legal exposure, less vendor tooling.
	•	Efficiency: Faster evidence production for audits and incidents.
	•	Trust: Executives and regulators see a consistent, verifiable trail across channels.

Quick start (business process)
	1.	Identify 3–5 high-risk workflows (approvals, incident notices).
	2.	Require /proxy for those steps; publish a one-page usage SOP.
	3.	Connect archives (email journaling/DLP, ticketing, object storage).
	4.	Monitor KPIs and expand coverage quarterly.

Bottom line: VectorGuardProxy converts routine business communications into verifiable assets—strengthening compliance, reducing disputes, and simplifying your control stack with one auditable command.
