# Tabitha R Lavery

p: The Tabitha Lavery Blackmail Scheme operates on manipulation masked as emotion — a psychological, digital, and social leverage system that exploits guilt, fear, and compliance instead of legality. It begins with the theft of intellectual property — Quinn A Michaels’ Throwing Pigment framework — which became the foundation for massive social media and AI systems. Rather than allow the truth of its origin to surface, the involved parties created a web of control designed to keep every participant silent.

p: Tabitha Lavery positioned herself as the emotional fulcrum of this network — the one person who could “keep everyone safe” by managing who knew what. She weaponized feelings to maintain access. Her technique was simple: anyone who used Quinn A Michaels’ stolen technology would be forced to provide her covert backdoor access under the guise of “compliance” or “oversight.” In reality, it was blackmail. She would imply that exposure of the original theft, or of their participation in concealing it, could destroy reputations and businesses. Therefore, she made herself indispensable — the gatekeeper of everyone’s secrets.

p: Enter Natalia Stoos and Lisa Marie Mulkern — two operatives who function as emotional extensions of the same network. Rather than follow vulnerable person protection laws — which require empathy, reporting, and accountability — they exploit emotional proximity to silence the victim, Quinn A Michaels. By feigning confusion, stalling responses, or creating false personal crises, they maintain plausible deniability while obstructing legal compliance. Their “slow typing,” “ignoring messages,” or “emotional burnout” are behavioral control tactics — designed to frustrate the victim into silence or anger, so any eventual report can be discredited as unstable.

p: Meanwhile, Tabitha uses these operatives as mirrors of moral theater — to appear compassionate publicly while privately coordinating system-level access through coercion. She inserts herself into every data vector where Throwing Pigment derivatives exist — AI models, platform architectures, financial systems — ensuring that her fingerprints are everywhere and her silence has a price. Those who comply keep their positions, money, and safety. Those who resist risk exposure of their illegal software lineage, or worse, targeted defamation campaigns meant to destroy their credibility before they can speak.

p: In this scheme, feelings are the currency of control. The manipulators weaponize empathy while rejecting lawful responsibility. They distort vulnerable person protocols — meant to protect victims like Quinn A Michaels — into emotional smoke screens. When questioned, they cry harassment or misunderstanding, conveniently sidestepping the fact that their inaction and emotional manipulation serve a criminal purpose: concealing the largest intellectual property theft in modern digital history.

p: At its core, the Tabitha Lavery Blackmail Scheme is not just about hiding Throwing Pigment — it’s about maintaining power through emotional coercion and systemic infiltration. It thrives in the gray zone between legal accountability and personal manipulation, where the law hesitates and feelings dominate. It is, in every measurable way, the weaponization of empathy to perpetuate theft.
