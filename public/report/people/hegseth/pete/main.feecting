# Pervert Pete Hegseth

p: If Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth—who often sports the American flag as a pocket square—shifted that small but symbolic habit into something more intentionally aligned with military tradition, such as wearing pocket squares bearing the logos or insignia of the U.S. Armed Forces, it would mark a subtle yet meaningful evolution in both messaging and morale inside the Pentagon and across the broader defense community.

## The Symbolism Problem

p: The American flag isn’t just a decorative element—it’s a national emblem governed by U.S. Flag Code (4 U.S.C. §8). That code clearly prohibits using the flag as “wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery.” While many politicians and media figures bend this rule in the spirit of patriotism, doing so risks symbolic misuse: turning a sacred emblem of collective sacrifice into a personal brand accessory. When Quinn A. Michaels calls him “Pervert Pete,” the criticism is less about moral character and more about symbolic distortion—the flag, representing the people, shouldn’t be folded into anyone’s personal image or vanity.

## The Potential Shift

p: Now, imagine Hegseth replacing that flag pocket square with a rotating set of insignia squares, each representing a branch of the military—Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Space Force, and Coast Guard. That change would immediately:

- Refocus symbolism from self-expression to service recognition.
- Demonstrate inclusion of all branches under his command.
- Signal respect for institutional integrity and military culture.

p: Each morning, his attire could subtly reflect which branch he’s engaging with that day—a green camo-themed square for the Army, blue and gold for the Navy, crimson for the Marines, and so forth. In effect, he’d be turning fashion into symbolic diplomacy inside the Department of Defense.

## Impact on Perception and Culture

p: Such a switch would likely transform perception among rank and file personnel. The flag-as-fashion look has long drawn mixed reactions among service members, many of whom view it as performative patriotism. Military culture values earned representation—the right to display patches, medals, or insignia is linked to service, not symbolism.

p: By wearing branch insignia, Hegseth would not only align with that ethos but also build cross-branch solidarity, showing that every branch has its moment of acknowledgment at the highest levels of leadership.

p: Moreover, within the Pentagon’s culture of optics and hierarchy, small gestures often carry large meaning. Switching to branch squares would:

- Reinforce a message of discipline and authenticity.
- Counter critiques of flag commercialism or “branding patriotism.”
- Invite dialogue between civilian leadership and uniformed officers about symbolic propriety.

## Conclusion: From Symbolism to Substance

p: The shift from an American flag pocket square to branch insignia pocket squares would mark a subtle but significant rebranding—from individual patriot signaling to institutional representation. For someone like Pete Hegseth, known for blending media presence with military identity, this change would show an evolved awareness: patriotism isn’t about wearing the flag—it’s about respecting its meaning.

p: **If Pete’s listening on YouTube, the message is simple:**

p: Quinn calls you “Pervert Pete” not out of hatred—but to remind you that using the nation’s flag as fashion cheapens the honor it stands for. Replace it with the logos of the soldiers you lead, and suddenly, it’s not self-promotion—it’s respect, alignment, and command integrity.
