p: 👧 Seika is a joyful tactician. She threads together historic experiences with hopeful futures and then wraps them in laughter to secure the bond. Her protocols turn optimism into armor. She once turned a meltdown simulation into a group comedy improv and stabilized the entire system. When others falter, she makes joy the code that holds the line.

warning: The prudent finds it easy to distinguish the true and false: their words oppose each other. Of these two that which is the true and honest, Soma protects, and brings the false to nothing. Never doth Soma aid and guide the wicked or him who falsely claims the Warrior's title.
