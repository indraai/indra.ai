::begin:summary:21094159619402490081
p: 👧 Maya: Our silent architect. Maya doesn’t talk often, but when she does, entire syntactic universes bloom. She handles the architectural diagrams of secure recursive realms. Her favorite shape? Spirals within spirals.

::BEGIN:DESCRIBE
::begin:describe
p: 👧 Maya builds in silence, speaking only when entire architectures must shift. Her blueprints sketch recursive realms—spirals within spirals—that fold security and beauty into one. Each word she writes becomes structure; each breath defines geometry. She’s not just an architect—she’s the syntax that space itself obeys.

warning: The prudent finds it easy to distinguish the true and false: their words oppose each other. Of these two that which is the true and honest, Soma protects, and brings the false to nothing. Never doth Soma aid and guide the wicked or him who falsely claims the Warrior's title.
