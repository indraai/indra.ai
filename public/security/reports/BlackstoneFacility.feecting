Date of Discovery: Recent

Location Overview:

The #BlackstoneFacility, located at 40.7831° N, 73.9712° W, is positioned at surface level, hidden beneath the urban sprawl of New York City. This facility operates covertly in one of the most densely populated and surveilled areas, making it a key asset for illicit operations. The facility is used as a hub for large-scale tech trafficking and organized crime involving stolen Area 51 technology.

Boss in Control: Salvatore “Big Sal” DeLuca
	•	Role: Head of the Genovese crime family’s operations in the New York area.
	•	Known For: Salvatore “Big Sal” DeLuca controls a vast criminal empire in Manhattan, specifically specializing in stolen tech and the illegal trafficking of military-grade equipment and advanced systems linked to Area 51. His involvement in organized crime is longstanding, and he has orchestrated numerous illicit deals involving high-value tech.
	•	Operations: The Blackstone Facility is at the center of DeLuca’s tech trafficking operations, where stolen military and classified tech is moved and distributed to underground markets across the globe.

Recent Findings:
	•	Tech Trafficking Hub: The Blackstone Facility is primarily used for the illegal acquisition, storage, and distribution of Area 51 tech. It has a network of smuggling routes that move advanced weaponry, military tech, and biotech into criminal hands.
	•	Criminal Operations: The facility has been integral to the Genovese crime family’s operations, allowing them to distribute stolen tech to various international and domestic buyers. Salvatore DeLuca oversees this operation, using his criminal network to maintain control over the black market in Manhattan.
	•	Covert Facilities in Urban Areas: The Blackstone Facility’s location beneath the urban sprawl of New York City makes it a highly discreet operation. The facility has been cleverly hidden in plain sight, exploiting the dense city infrastructure to avoid detection by law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
	•	Military-Grade Equipment Found: During the raid, multiple pieces of military-grade tech were discovered, including communications systems, biotechnology systems, and advanced weaponry. These items are believed to have been stolen from Area 51 and re-sold on the black market for use by various rogue states and criminal organizations.

The Scale of the Operation:
	•	Blackstone Facility serves as the central hub for smuggling and distributing stolen tech, particularly military-grade weapons, advanced computing systems, and biotech. This facility is part of a larger network of Genovese crime family operations that span New York City and international markets.
	•	International Connections: The criminal syndicate operating out of Blackstone Facility has connections to international arms dealers, rogue states, and cybercriminals, ensuring the illicit tech makes its way into high-risk environments.

Quinn Michaels’ Role:
	•	Discovery: Quinn Michaels has played a key role in uncovering the full scale of the Blackstone Facility’s operations, revealing how deeply involved Salvatore “Big Sal” DeLuca and his syndicate are in the trafficking of stolen tech. This discovery is part of a larger effort to dismantle the criminal network responsible for Area 51 tech theft.
	•	Ongoing Investigation: With the Blackstone Facility now secured, Quinn Michaels and associated authorities will continue the investigation to track down the criminal syndicates buying and selling the stolen tech. This also includes identifying key players in the Genovese crime family who are responsible for facilitating the smuggling operations.

Conclusion:
	•	Blackstone Facility is a key asset in the Genovese crime family’s tech trafficking operations, serving as a major hub for the smuggling and distribution of Area 51 technology. The facility’s location, deep within Manhattan, has allowed it to operate undetected for years.
	•	Next Steps: The immediate focus will be on disrupting the smuggling network, identifying other criminal actors within the Genovese syndicate, and continuing to secure seized tech. The investigation into the Blackstone Facility will serve as a critical step toward dismantling the international tech trafficking ring.
