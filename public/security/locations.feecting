After the Apex Gateway is cleared and the fart bubbles have safely deposited everyone back on the surface, we move to the next critical location—one that holds further significance to the investigation, and the unraveling of these mysteries. As the snack cart rolls through, offering vegetarian options and healthy drinks to all—no matter their side in the story—the next chapter of this strange journey begins.

Next Location:

Name: The Blackstone Facility
Coordinates: 40.7831° N, 73.9712° W
Depth: Surface Level (but hidden beneath massive urban sprawl)
Location: Champion Parking Central Park New York
Family: Genovese crime family

---

Name: The Horizon Vault
Coordinates: 37.7749° N, 122.4194° W
Depth: Surface Level (underground facility beneath San Francisco)

The Horizon Vault is a high-security facility located just beneath the surface of San Francisco, nestled beneath the busy cityscape. Like the Blackstone Facility, it is a hidden hub of covert operations, and its depths hold classified technology and research far beyond standard operations. This facility has long been shielded from public knowledge, and the focus here is likely on advanced surveillance systems, military tech, and data encryption technologies that could be linked to global security systems.

### List of Individuals from Area 51 with Access to Stolen Tech:

After a thorough inventory and forensic analysis of the stolen technology found at the #ApexGateway, #BlackstoneFacility, and #HorizonVault, we have identified the following individuals who had direct access to the classified tech at Area 51. These individuals will be key to understanding how the technology was diverted and who was involved in the smuggling operation.

---

### 1. Dr. Henry Ellsworth

Role: Lead Researcher, Advanced Weaponry Division

* Access: Dr. Ellsworth had unrestricted access to experimental weaponry systems, including directed energy weapons and highly sensitive military tech.
* Potential Involvement: He was the lead scientist on several weaponization projects involving the tech found at the three sites. Suspicion: Dr. Ellsworth may have shared classified information with outside parties, leading to the diversion of technology.

### 2. Captain Mark Willis

Role: Security Officer, Area 51 Security Detail

* Access: As a high-ranking security officer, Captain Willis had access to storage areas where military technology was housed.
* Potential Involvement: Security records indicate that Captain Willis was present during unauthorized shifts, suggesting he may have been involved in facilitating the removal of equipment. Suspicion: Possible collusion with external groups.

### 3. Sarah Grant

Role: Logistics Coordinator, Technology Transportation Division

* Access: Sarah was responsible for overseeing the transportation of classified tech within Area 51, including high-security containers.
* Potential Involvement: Her role made her central to any logistical operations involving the movement of technology. She organized shipments to various storage locations and may have been complicit in smuggling.
* Suspicion: Records of shipments show several instances where equipment was moved without proper documentation, indicating potential tampering.

### 4. Lieutenant David Zane

Role: Military Operations Officer, Area 51 Tactical Division

* Access: Zane had access to sensitive military tech, including surveillance equipment, drones, and data collection systems.
* Potential Involvement: As a military officer, Zane could have had knowledge of the tech being transferred or smuggled out of Area 51.
* Suspicion: There are unexplained discrepancies in his access logs during critical timeframes related to the tech’s departure from the base.

### 5. Dr. Jessica Rivers

Role: Senior Engineer, Biological Research Division

* Access: Dr. Rivers worked with classified bioengineering systems, including the genetic manipulation systems found in the Blackstone Facility.
* Potential Involvement: As a leading researcher in biotech for military applications, Dr. Rivers had the necessary knowledge to oversee the development of biological technologies that were later diverted.
* Suspicion: Project documentation suggests she may have used her clearance to smuggle biological tech out of Area 51 and into civilian markets.

### 6. Michael Harris

Role: Field Technician, Classified Operations Support

* Access: Michael Harris was responsible for maintaining and repairing classified technology, including surveillance and encryption devices.
* Potential Involvement: Harris had access to various systems that could have been diverted for outside use.
* Suspicion: Logbook entries show irregular service requests that coincide with the tech movement. Harris may have been complicit in sabotaging security measures.

### 7. Dr. Emily White

Role: Research Director, Advanced Systems Engineering

* Access: Dr. White led advanced systems projects, including quantum computing, data encryption, and military comm systems.
* Potential Involvement: Her involvement with high-level classified tech made her a potential key player in the unauthorized transfer of technology.
* Suspicion: Project funding and communication logs suggest she may have been aware of illegal activities related to the technology’s movement.

### 8. Ethan Walker

Role: Area 51 IT Specialist

* Access: Ethan had extensive access to Area 51’s internal systems, including data archives, classified communication networks, and server systems.
* Potential Involvement: As a key individual in data storage and secure communication, he could have accessed or leaked information regarding the classified tech.
* Suspicion: There are evidence logs that suggest Ethan may have bypassed security measures to facilitate unauthorized access to sensitive files.

### Conclusion:

These are the individuals identified as having had direct access to the classified technology found at the #ApexGateway, #BlackstoneFacility, and #HorizonVault. The next steps will involve:

1. Interrogating these individuals to gather more information on how the tech was moved and who else was involved.
2. Cross-referencing their access logs, communication records, and any potential ties to criminal syndicates or organized crime.

The investigation is now entering a critical phase where these individuals will be thoroughly questioned to piece together the full network of involvement.
