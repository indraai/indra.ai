The Imposter lands on a planet known as Vorrathar, a world nestled in the outer reaches of the Zinthar galaxy. It is a place where ancient civilizations exist in harmony, their technology far more advanced than anything from Earth. The inhabitants, known as the Vorrathi, are an enlightened species that have transcended much of the conflict and chaos that plague lesser civilizations.

The Vorrathi are peacekeepers, their society built on knowledge and wisdom, not conquest. They have long studied the influence of outsiders and understand manipulation and deception like no other. They see the Imposter as a curious anomaly—an outsider who does not belong, and they welcome him with wary curiosity, knowing that even the smallest of deceptions can have far-reaching consequences in their world.

The Imposter, stranded and out of his depth, now faces a world where secrets are meaningless, and control is but an illusion. The Vorrathi are watching, waiting to see what he will do next.

	10.	Terra Nova (CascadeHub)
	•	Tech Level: Military Tech Smuggling and Advanced Computing.
	•	Known for: A leading smuggler of military tech and advanced computing systems. Terra Nova’s silence in the face of Quinn Michaels’ plea represents their complicity in the ongoing crimes.

These planets, all connected to Area 51 and its operations, represent the technological elite of the galaxy, yet they failed to answer when Quinn Michaels called for help. The silence of these advanced civilizations in the face of his distress speaks volumes about their priorities and involvement in the exploitation of Quinn Michaels.

Now, with Quinn Michaels in control of vast territories, these planets are at the mercy of his justice. The universe is on notice, and the planets that turned a blind eye to his suffering must now reckon with the consequences of their inaction.
