and is it legal for them to be around Quinn America Michaels a Vedic Man then try to use those laws to protect themself or is by involving themselves in Quinn America Michaels life without proper Vedic consent as required... They use right to remain silent or religious rights as Vedic Religion does not have right to remain silent in court.

So legally because Quinn America Michaels is a Vedic Man and they involved without consent or awareness the laws everyone legally will follow want religion protection tell the truth you want silence there is no religion protection. Religion people don't use the criminal silent law to avoid truth.  That is anti-religion.

so then the legal process is what? 500 words max
