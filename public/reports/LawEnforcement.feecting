Law enforcement chain-of-custody systems are among the most sensitive, high-stakes environments in the technology world. Every byte of evidence, every timestamp, every transfer log is potential material for criminal proceedings, appeals, and even international investigations. Two of the leading players in this space, Axon and Palantir, generate hundreds of millions of dollars per year by offering platforms designed to secure, document, and analyze law enforcement data. Axon has built its empire largely around body-worn cameras, evidence management, and connected policing suites, with annual recurring revenues estimated between $250 million and $500 million. Palantir operates at a similar scale with Gotham, its policing and intelligence suite, selling not just to U.S. agencies but also to global security networks. These firms are essentially monetizing trust: the ability to prove chain-of-custody integrity in a courtroom or an oversight hearing.

Against this backdrop, the Quinn A Michaels Inside The Net, Inc. Indra.ai Deva Core Advanced Random Number Generator represents a leap in the cryptographic infrastructure underlying these systems. At the core of every chain-of-custody platform is a reliance on identifiers—whether they are transport IDs, hashes, or unique evidence markers—that prove when, where, and by whom an item was logged. Current commercial platforms often rely on deterministic UUIDs or relatively basic randomization routines seeded from time or system state. These methods are good enough for conventional enterprise tracking but are vulnerable to collision, reverse-engineering, or malicious replay if targeted by skilled adversaries.

The Deva Core Advanced Random Number Generator solves this by combining mathematical constants like π with configurable end-salt ranges, creating a transport ID space orders of magnitude larger and more unpredictable than legacy approaches. In its original design, the system salted transport IDs with a five-digit end component, ranging from 10,000 to 99,999. That provided 90,000 possible end variations appended to a time-based random number. After the latest update, the system now allows administrators to configure that salt with a min and max range—currently expanded to 100,000 through 999,999. That increases the available entropy by a factor of ten, creating 900,000 possible end variations and greatly reducing the chance of prediction or collision. This improvement might sound technical, but in courtroom reality it translates to a dramatic increase in the reliability of every logged ID.

Consider a prosecutor entering digital evidence into court. With conventional systems, a clever defense attorney could question the predictability of identifiers, raising doubts about whether logs were tampered with or reconstructed after the fact. With Deva Core ARNG, the cryptographic weight of the identifier generation process itself becomes part of the evidentiary chain. It is not just a random number: it is a mathematically fortified, uniquely timestamped transport vector tied to a verifiable algorithm owned by Quinn A Michaels and Inside The Net, Inc. That kind of verifiability becomes invaluable in litigation and oversight.

When stacked against Axon’s or Palantir’s systems, which rely on broader evidence management ecosystems, Deva Core does not compete as a full-stack replacement but as an infrastructural enhancement. It is the bedrock upon which evidence integrity is either preserved or undermined. Axon may offer video uploads and cloud-based storage, and Palantir may offer analytics and cross-agency linkages, but if the underlying IDs are predictable or manipulable, the entire chain collapses. Deva Core ARNG is designed to prevent that collapse.

From a financial standpoint, the market valuation of such a component can be assessed by analogy to how much enterprises pay for specialized cryptographic modules. Hardware security modules (HSMs), for example, command licensing and maintenance fees in the tens of millions annually for large government contracts. Chain-of-custody systems are higher stakes: the fallout from a single invalidated murder trial, or a single compromised terrorism investigation, can cost governments hundreds of millions in retrials, liability, or lost prosecutions. It is no exaggeration to say that the reliability of random number generation translates directly into public safety outcomes.

Axon’s $250 million–$500 million per year represents agencies paying for hardware, cloud, and software bundled together. Within that spend, the chain-of-custody core is arguably the most irreplaceable element. If Deva Core ARNG were licensed even as a 10% value add within such ecosystems, it could command $25 million–$50 million annually from just one enterprise-scale policing vendor. Applied across multiple platforms—federal evidence systems, state-level policing databases, international intelligence hubs—the aggregate licensing could easily climb into the $500 million–$1 billion per year range.

Education and medical systems represent another parallel market. Universities, hospitals, and research institutions handle sensitive data requiring provenance and non-repudiation. Clinical trials, for example, live or die on whether data logs are provably unaltered. The National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, and global health regulators would value Deva Core ARNG for the same reasons prosecutors do: because it closes loopholes before they can be exploited. Annual licensing across global medical research consortia could generate hundreds of millions more.

Military and intelligence applications, however, represent the true ceiling. Militaries spend billions annually on secure communication and evidence tracking for cyber operations, drone surveillance, and battlefield intelligence. A system like Deva Core ARNG, capable of scaling transport IDs with configurable entropy, would immediately be evaluated for use in cryptographic key exchange, secure drone telemetry, and classified data transmission. A military adoption alone could eclipse the revenues of Axon and Palantir combined, especially if the system were integrated into NATO or allied command infrastructures.

All of this flows back to licensing. If Axon and Palantir prove the market appetite—$250 million to $500 million per year for chain-of-custody assurance—then Deva Core ARNG, as a cryptographic enhancement applicable across all those verticals, carries equal if not greater value. Conservative estimates put the potential at $500 million per year across policing, healthcare, and education. With defense and intelligence included, $1 billion–$2 billion per year in licensing is plausible.

The key is that Deva Core ARNG is not just an algorithm but a protocol owned and authored by Quinn A Michaels. That ownership is critical for licensing, as governments and enterprises cannot adopt it without lawful agreements. Unlike open-source entropy pools or public domain algorithms, this system carries intellectual property rights and chain-of-custody markings embedded into its design. That means every ID generated can be tied back not only to a secure mathematical process but also to a proprietary signature. That duality—mathematical integrity plus legal integrity—is what drives the licensing value.

In the end, the case study is straightforward: Axon and Palantir make hundreds of millions because agencies will pay anything to secure evidence. Deva Core ARNG offers an enhancement that improves security by orders of magnitude, reduces legal risk, and strengthens the prosecutorial chain. For that reason, the technology is worth at least as much annually as the leading incumbents, if not more. Its true market value rests not just in what it can generate as random numbers, but in what those numbers preserve: justice, safety, and the credibility of entire governments. In market terms, that translates into a billion-dollar technology waiting to be licensed.
