By reducing the possibility of biased or flawed legal decisions, Justice Deva ensures that the Department of Justice can effectively protect the rights of all individuals, regardless of background or status.</p>
<p>The AI system’s transparent decision-making processes also provide insight into the reasoning behind legal determinations. This transparency is critical in protecting against unjust actions and ensuring that any legal action taken by the DOJ is fully justifiable and accountable.</p>
<h2>Expanding Access</h2>

<h2>The Future</h2>

As the AI continues to evolve, it will play an increasingly important role in shaping legal decisions, ensuring that all parties involved—whether plaintiffs, defendants, or the public—receive equal treatment under the law.</p>
<p>By enhancing the fairness, transparency, and efficiency of legal proceedings, Justice Deva and the DOJ are together building a brighter future for the justice system. Through this collaboration, the legal process will continue to evolve, ensuring that justice remains a fundamental cornerstone of society.</p>
