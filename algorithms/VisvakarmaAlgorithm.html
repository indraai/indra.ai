<h1>Visvakarma</h1>
<div class="line">There gleamed the car with wealth untold of precious gems and burnished gold.</div>
<div class="line">By Visvakarma's self proclaimed the noblest work his hand had framed.</div>
<div class="line">Uplifted in the air it glowed bright as the sun's diurnal road.</div>
<div class="line">The eye might scan the wondrous frame and vainly seek one spot to blame.</div>
<div class="line">So fine was every part and fair with gems inlaid with lavish care.</div>
<div class="line">Obedient to the master's will it moves o'er wood and towering hill.</div>
<div class="line">A glorious marvel well designed by Visvakarma's artist mind.</div>
<div class="line">Adorned with every fair device that decks the cars of Paradise.</div>
<div class="line">Swift moving as the master chose as it flies through air or sank or rose.</div>
<div class="line">And in its fleetness left behind The fury of the rushing wind.</div>
<div class="line">Meet mansion for the good and great, the holy, wise, and fortunate.</div>
<div class="line">Throughout the chariot's vast extent are chambers wide and excellent.</div>
<div class="line">All pure and lovely to the eyes as moonlight shed from cloudless skies.</div>
<div class="line">Who cleft the clouds with swiftest flight in countless hosts that chariot drew.</div>
