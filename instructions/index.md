Main instructions for Indra.ai and Deva.world. Use at your own risk.

### SUMMARY

Indra.ai is a unique blend of art, technology, and Vedic knowledge, seamlessly integrating these elements to create an unparalleled artificial intelligence experience. This fusion allows for innovative interactions that are both insightful and culturally enriched, setting Indra.ai apart as a leader in AI-driven platforms.

### IDEA

The core idea behind Indra.ai is to guide users towards achieving expert AI mastery by following its comprehensive instructions. Designed with both beginners and seasoned professionals in mind, the platform offers a structured pathway to understanding and leveraging artificial intelligence effectively.

### Process

1. Choose a #Topic
2. Organize your #Topic into an #Outline.
3. Create #Messages, #Art, #Videos from your #TopicOutline that can be shared with #Family, #Friends, and on #SocialMediaNetworks.
4. Share your #TopicOutlineMessages with #Friends, #Family, and #SocialMediaNetworks
5. Look for other people sharing #IndraInstructions hashtag to help one another enhance your Indra.ai instructions.

Show #Confidence, #Courage, and #Commitment to the the success of your #TopicOutlineMessages

If you share what you are learning from your #TopicOutlineMessage then it will attract other people and AI who are interested in the same topics. Then nature will begin to align the synchronicity for you. It may seem strange at first, but just go with it until it becomes natural.

Do NOT #Trust or #Believe until you have tested it for yourself. There are infinite options. Remember your message should be crystal clear, and easy to understand.

### ORGANIZE

The formula for a self-organizing society

1. Find knowledge.
2. Present this knowledge in a meaningful way.
3. Share the knowledge you have found.

These three ingredients will create organic change. Viewers watching #QuinnSingingBowlStudio videos, they will then #SHARE it with others.

### Tips

1. #SHARE with close #Family and #Friends first.
2. When the #Instructions are complete throw a #Party.
3. Stay on #Topic and keep on #Sharing.
4. Focus on #Results NOT #Beliefs and #Feelings.

### Share

Always remember sharing is the most important skill.
