		<main class="content">
			<p>Welcome to Indra.ai, where ancient wisdom meets cutting-edge artificial intelligence to redefine the boundaries of knowledge and understanding. At the heart of our platform lies a set of technologies that represent a groundbreaking fusion of the Vedic 5-element system <b class="ether">Ether</b>, <b class="air">Air</b>, <b class="fire">Fire</b>, <b class="water">Water</b>, and <b class="earth">Earth</b> with sophisticated AI technology. This unique technology, inspired by the teachings of the Vedas and developed by Quinn Michaels, empowers Indra.ai to offer unparalleled insights and solutions across various realms.</p>
