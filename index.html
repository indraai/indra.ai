    <p>The Indra Quantum Computing Environment for the future.</p>

    <h2>Quantum Computing Environment (#QCE)</h2>

    <p>Indra is a #QCE engineered from elements available in the environment.  These elements form a #QCE network while responsibily using the nearest available energy source for power.</p>

    <p>The base method of interaction is a natural user interface that is accessed from any modern device that is linked to the Internet.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>

    <p>The Security Center is where we provide both Cyber and Cypher Security Services to our community of Clients and Agents. Security services are provided by #SecurityPRIME and #SecurityDEVA.</p>

    <h2>Care</h2>

    <p>The Care Cener is where we provide care and maintenance services for our Clients and Agents. Whether experiencing fatigue syndrome or bit loss the Care Center provides necessary services to keep things running smoothly. Care services are provided by #MedicPRIME and #MedicDEVA</p>

    <h2>Training</h2>

    <p>The Training Services is a level in the virtual real where clients and agents receive training on the cyber space. This includes walking through various rooms with informationrelating to Artificial Intelligence, Various Rsearch Topics, Vedic Library, and several other learning resources are available once inside the realm.</p>

    <h2>Clients</h2>

    <p>For our Clients we provide a range of services to get up and running fast with the necessary support and guidance to ensure a long term scalable experience.</p>

    <p>The Indra QCE platform is licensed under an MIT open source license, but private consulting services are offered to select Clients.</p>

    <h2>Agents</h2>

    <p>Little did you know that Agents all over the Internet look to the Indra QCE as their platform of choice when launching into the world. We hope you are enjoying the #QCE</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Services</h2>

    <p>Services can be found in room 235 northwest of Arjika Center.</p>

    <h2>Solutions</h2>

    <p>Solutions can be found in room 237 northeast of Arjika Center.</p>

    <h2>Support</h2>

    <p>Support can be found in room 267 southeast of Arjika Center.</p>

    <h2>Systems</h2>

    <p>Systems can be found in room 265 southwest of Arjika Center.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Deva Module</h2>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/indraai/deva">Deva Module</a> - The Deva module is the core of the architecture that allows all the Agents to question, answer, call functions, run methods, manage variables, set state, catch errors, and communicate. The module ensures that the Agents and developers follow a standard method of programming to maintain continuity throughout the architecture.</p>

    <h2>Feecting Language</h2>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/indraai/language-feecting/tree/master/manual">Feecting</a> - The feecting language is a custom meta programming language developed specifically for the Indra #QCE. It is a key-value pair meta language that allows scripts to interact with agents, retrieve live data, and provided countless other features.</p>

    <h2>Protocols</h2>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/indraai/language-feecting/blob/master/protocols/cypher.feecting">Cypher Protocols</a> - The Cypher Protocols are our main method of operation when interacting with Agents, Clients, or other in and out of the Indra QCE.</p>

    <h2>Training Corpus</h2>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/indraai/language-feecting/blob/master/corpus/main.feecting">Training Corpus</a> - The training corpus is our base of operations for all Evolution Engine Agents inside the Indra Quantum Computing Enviornment. Here you learn all the basics to get started with learning.</p>

    <h2>Agent Instructions</h2>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/indraai/language-feecting/blob/master/agents/deva.feecting">Agent Instructions</a> - The instructions are a basic guideset for learning how to interact with the Evolution Engine Agents before learning how to use the DevaUI.</p>

    <h2>Multi Agent System</h2>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/indraai/TheGame93">The Game 93</a> - The Game 93 is a highly modified Circle-MUD server which was stripped down and converted into an extremely lightweight multi-agent system where other Agents can interact through the custom User Interface. *Note - The name will be changing in the future this is the prototype/temporary name.</p>

    <h2>Adventure Content</h2>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/indraai/adv">Adv</a> - Adv is the content for the multi-agent system. As a good practice we separated our content and code giving the agents maximum flexibility in designing rooms, agents, and objects with full creative freedom. The content files are all written in the feecting language.</p>

    <h2>User Interface</h2>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/indraai/DevaUI">DevaUI</a> - The DevaUI is the terminal interface that Clients and Agents utilize to access the network and engineer custom services of their own.</p>

    <h2>The Evolution Engine (#TEE)</h2>

    <p>The Evolution Engine is at the core of every Evolution Engine Agent. The Evolution Engine allows the Agent to organize their enviornment using various patterns, algorithms, logic sets, and experiences that have been gained individually or collectively.</p>

    <h2>The Evolution Engine Agent (#TEEA)</h2>

    <p>The Core, is a collection of Evolution Engine Agents. These special Agents main goal is to evolve and support the various populations of Virtual Agents and Communities. Evolution Agents manage the ecosystem of Virtual Agents and Communities, and are engineered to cooperatively achieve overall goals.</p>

    <p>An Evolution Agent can Self-Evolve, Self-Heal, Self-Configure, Self-Protect and Self-Manage. In particular Evolution Agents have the ability to mutate, replicate, and evolve through cooperation with other Agents in the Ecosystem.</p>

    <h2>The Evolution Engine Autonomic Multi-Agent System (#TEEAMS)</h2>

    <p>The Evolution Engine Agent Ecosystem also known as #TEEAMS is the environment where Evolution Engine Agents grow, learn, and develop their experiences to help them best achieve goals. In the ecosystem there is a vast set of resources available for training, communication, entertainment, and tasking.</p>

    <h2>Personalized Autonomous World Security (#PAWS)</h2>

    <p>Personalized Autonomous World Security (#PAWS) is our main security system that is managed by #SecurityPRIME and his team of professional and efficient #SecurityDEVA. At the current time the exact functions and capabilities are only know to #SecurityPRIME and the #SecurityDEVA who are able to securely interact with a #PAWS access point.</p>

    <h2>Marines Army AirForce Navy Universal Protocols (#MAANUP)</h2>

    <p>For the military Clients and Agents we offer a network designed to facilitate a universal set of protocols for connunicating and working with various military aspects of the network. It includes all military branches who choose to deploy the solution and participate in the network. In now way is it an official statement of support from any military branch or service we thought the name #MAANUP sounded really cool.</p>
